This is a simple exploration of the [MOZ Links API](https://moz.com/help/links-api). 

## Setup

<img alt="MOZ Roger Robot" src="moz-roger-robot.jpg" width="150vw"
style="padding: 7px 10px 2px 0; float: left; height: auto">This is the first in
a series of Jupyter Notebooks using MOZ resources. It should work on any
Notebook hosting platform such as Google Colab or Azure Notebook. However, we
will soon be doing browser automation which will require a local <a

## Usage

Load the notebook into your Notebook hosting platform and run the cells.
